<h3>Situation</h3>

Overwhelming volume of resources, feeds, and other manual action requirements to garner data from external sources.

<h3>Problem</h3>

How can I reduce the amount of time invested in manually seeking out data and, instead, have the data come to me?

<h3>Possible Solution</h3>

Automate a possible Cyber Threat Intelligence Feed (or as much as is available with current tools in the marketplace).

<h3>Initial Goal</h3>

Receive information about phishing websites, as identified through VirusTotal.

<h3>Initial Tech Stack</h3>

+ N8N – Primary Lab Resource & Trigger Orchestration (another version of Zapier, if you will)
+ VirusTotal – Origin of Websites
+ URLScan.io – Assess Websites
+ Slack - Receiving Source
